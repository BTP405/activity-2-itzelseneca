(10 points) Consider the following code blocks which generate the same output.
(7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.

#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')

The first approach uses a function doubleL which initializes an empty list, iterates from 0 to n-1, appends to the res list the current number multiplied by 2 and returns the list. The DoubleL function is called with the value 5 within a for loop, so it iterates through the list returned by the function, printing each element with the ending changed from newline to ' : '.
 
#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

The second approach uses a comprehension to generate a list. To do this it iterates from 0 to 4, multiplying n by 2 and adding the result to the list. Then, it goes through the list printing the numbers and the ending is changed from newline to ' : '.

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')

The third approach uses a generator function that creates the numbers from 0 to n-1, multiplied by 2. Then it calls the function with 5 and iterates over the numbers and prints them out with the end changed from newline to ' : '

(3 points) What type of function is doubleG(n)? What is the advantage of using such a function?
The function doubleG(n) is a generator function as it contains a yield statement. When we call it, it returns a generator object. The advantage of using such a function is that it makes our memory management more efficient. This is because values are calculated at runtime and not stored into memory. This is useful when we have to print a large number of items which would normally take up a lot of memory, with generator functions we can keep the memory usage to a minimun.
